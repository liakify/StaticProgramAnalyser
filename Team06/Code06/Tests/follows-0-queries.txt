6 - indirect follows -> false (1, 3)

7 - nothing before first stmt

8 - nothing after last stmt

9 - last line of if and first line of else stmt branches do not follows

10 - same statement do not follows - Follows(7, 7)

- same nesting lvl different stmt list - Follows (9, 15)

11 - if and following stmt - (ifs, s)

- while and following stmt - (w, s)
